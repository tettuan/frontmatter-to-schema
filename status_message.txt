**Current Situation:**
CI pipeline passes successfully with 348 tests (1404 steps) and type safety maintained. Core CLI functionality works perfectly, meeting requirements for single-stage processing. The refactor/ddd-totality-fixes branch is active with architectural improvements ready for implementation.

**Things to be Done:**
Critical architectural consolidation remains the priority. Four template processors need unification: TypescriptTemplateProcessor (362 lines), PlaceholderProcessor (485 lines), TemplateMapper.applyDataToTemplateStrict (192 lines), and additional duplicate implementations. Two-stage processing architecture requires main.ts migration from ProcessDocumentsUseCase to TwoStageProcessingUseCase. Result type boundary violations across 67 files need domain layer cleanup to achieve true DDD separation and eliminate infrastructure dependencies from core business logic.

Priority focus: Template processor consolidation and proper two-stage architecture implementation while maintaining 80%+ test coverage and type safety standards.
