**Current Situation:**
Develop branch fully integrated with all feature branches merged. CI passing with 347 tests green. ErrorHandlerService and VerboseLoggerService added. Phase 3 and 4 DDD refactoring complete with ProcessDocumentsUseCase reduced 88% to 48 lines.

**Things to be Done:**
Close PRs #513 and #514 as changes already merged to develop. Close issues #498 (massive methods), #499 (RegistryBuilder tests), #500 (code duplication). Push develop to origin and prepare main branch merge.
