**Current Situation:**
CI pipeline passes successfully with 280 tests and type safety maintained. Core CLI functionality works perfectly for document processing. The codebase has been simplified by removing two-stage mode complexity.

**Things to be Done:**
Critical architectural consolidation remains the priority. Four template processors need unification: TypescriptTemplateProcessor (362 lines), PlaceholderProcessor (485 lines), TemplateMapper.applyDataToTemplateStrict (192 lines), and additional duplicate implementations. Result type boundary violations across 67 files need domain layer cleanup to achieve true DDD separation and eliminate infrastructure dependencies from core business logic.

Priority focus: Template processor consolidation while maintaining 80%+ test coverage and type safety standards.
