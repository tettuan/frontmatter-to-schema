**Current Situation:**
CI pipeline passes successfully with all 349 tests green. Fixed critical type errors by removing non-existent ErrorHandlerService imports and replacing with createDomainError from domain/core/result.ts. Corrected DomainError kinds to use valid types SchemaValidationFailed and TemplateMappingFailed.

**Things to be Done:**
Merge open PRs #513 (Phase 4 refactoring) and #514 (code duplication fixes). Close related issues #498, #499, #500. Complete template processor consolidation to eliminate remaining duplication across TypescriptTemplateProcessor, PlaceholderProcessor, and TemplateMapper implementations.
