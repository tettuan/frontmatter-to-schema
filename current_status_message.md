CI passing with 424 tests. Deep investigation completed via climpt-debug. Created issue #616 for critical test gaps: DocumentProcessor has zero tests, 5 CLI tests disabled. Open P1 issues: #592 (schema processing), #590 (architecture refactoring), #591 (implementation strategy). Need to address test coverage gaps and continue with high-priority refactoring tasks.
