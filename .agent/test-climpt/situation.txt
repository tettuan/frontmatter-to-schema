PR #506 created for Issue #505 hardcoding fixes. Branch fix/hardcoding-violations-505 pushed with all tests passing. CI fully green with 347 tests. Multiple critical issues remain: #497 command structure hardcoding, #501 domain violations, #495/#496 registry schema problems. Need to switch to next priority issue #497 about c1/c2/c3 command structure being hardcoded in schema instead of being schema-driven.
