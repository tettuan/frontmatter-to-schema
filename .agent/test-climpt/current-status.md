## Current Situation

Completed Issue #505 (hardcoding violations) with all 347 tests passing and CI
green. Two major issues (#503 totality violations, #505 hardcoding) resolved on
respective branches. Codebase now follows totality principles and
prohibit-hardcoding regulations.

## Things to be Done

Multiple high-priority bug issues remain open: #497 hardcoded command structure,
#501 domain boundary violations, #495/#496 registry schema issues. Need to merge
completed work to develop, then tackle remaining critical issues systematically.
