# Frontmatter-to-Schema v1.0.0 Release Notes

## Overview

First stable production release of frontmatter-to-schema, a flexible Markdown
frontmatter parser that converts to template formats using schema definitions.
This release achieves full implementation of core requirements with robust test
coverage and production-ready stability.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality

- **Schema-driven Processing**: Flexible schema definitions with JSON Schema
  support
- **Template Variable Resolution**: Mode-based null/undefined handling
  (normal/verbose)
- **x-frontmatter-part Support**: Hierarchical data structure processing
- **x-derived-from Aggregation**: Automatic field derivation and uniqueness
- **Multi-format Output**: JSON, YAML, TOML, and Markdown formatting

### Architecture

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Totality Pattern**: Result<T,E> types for comprehensive error handling
- **Test-Driven Development**: 80.1% coverage with 193 tests
- **No Hardcoding**: Fully configurable schema and template paths

## Changes Since Pre-Release

### Issues Resolved

- **#814**: Implemented mode-based null/undefined template variable handling
- **#808**: Reduced test code duplication with TestDataFactory pattern
- **#810**: Fixed template variable resolution with DDD/Totality refactoring
- **#809**: Prepared and released v1.0.0

### Technical Improvements

- Enhanced variable replacement strategy with verbose mode support
- Consolidated test utilities reducing 72 duplications across 12 files
- Improved CLI architecture with dynamic orchestrator creation
- Stabilized template rendering with proper null handling

## Testing & Quality

- **Test Suite**: 193 tests passing across unit, integration, and E2E
- **Coverage**: 80.1% line coverage maintained
- **CI Pipeline**: Full automation with Deno CI tool
- **Performance**: Average CI stage time 480ms, total 2.4s

## Known Issues (Deferred to v2.0.0)

The following non-critical enhancements have been identified and deferred to
v2.0.0:

- **#817**: Remove x-frontmatter-part hardcoding for improved abstraction
- **#818**: Add specification-driven test scenarios
- **#819**: Improve DDD separation of concerns in schema extensions

These issues do not impact current functionality and are marked for
architectural improvements in the next major version.
