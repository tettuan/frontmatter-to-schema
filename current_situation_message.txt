Current situation: CI is passing with 223 tests and 943 steps successful, but several critical issues remain open. Major problems include template array processing completely broken (Issue #408), AI complexity control violations with entropy explosion (Issue #409), totality principle violations with 136 exception-based control flows (Issue #411), and TDD violations where tests don't reflect specifications (Issue #405).

Things to be done: Immediate priorities are (1) Fix exception-based control flow by converting 136 throw statements to Result types, (2) Implement Smart Constructor pattern for all value objects, (3) Resolve template array processing $ref resolution missing, and (4) Add specification-driven tests aligned with domain architecture documents.
