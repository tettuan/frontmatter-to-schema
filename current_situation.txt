MULTIPLE ISSUES RESOLVED: Issues #416 (repository interface), #405 (TDD violation), and #415 (dual error architecture) all COMPLETED! Phase 2&3 DDD/Totality refactoring COMPLETED. CI fully passing with TypeScript compilation, JSR compatibility, tests (281 passed), lint, and format checks all successful. Template class consolidated to DDD entities, repository interface unified, dual error architecture resolved. Critical nullability eliminated via discriminated unions. Entropy reduced to 17.8 bits. Infrastructure layer totality-compliant with Result patterns. PRs #424, #425 created and ready for review.

THINGS TO BE DONE:
- Complete branch merge cleanup (climpt-git workflow in progress)
- Continue Phase 4 domain boundary optimization and #408 template arrays, #409 AI complexity resolution
- Address additional totality violations systematically
- Maintain entropy control <18 bits during development
