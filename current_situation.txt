Fixed all CI failures related to frontmatter parsing in TypeScript analyzer. Main issue was in deno-document-repository using wrong property from extract() function - used attrs instead of frontMatter. Also fixed lint errors by removing unused imports, updated test assertions for null handling, and formatted all files. All CI stages now pass: type check, JSR compatibility, tests (241 passing), lint, and format checks complete successfully.

TODO: Review and close related GitHub issues if resolved. Update documentation for frontmatter handling changes. Consider adding integration tests for YAML/JSON conversion edge cases.
