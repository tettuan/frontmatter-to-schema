CURRENT SITUATION & NEXT ACTIONS

✅ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED: ValidationError Migration Complete
The entire codebase has been successfully migrated from the legacy ValidationError system to the new unified DomainError system. All 187 TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved, and CI is now passing all stages (Type Check, JSR Compatibility, Test Execution, Lint Check, Format Check) with 281 tests passing.

🎯 THINGS TO BE DONE:
1. Close open issues and PRs related to ValidationError migration
2. Address remaining critical issues: #417 type safety violations, #408 template array processing, #409 AI complexity entropy explosion
3. Review and potentially merge pending pull requests
4. Update project documentation to reflect the new error handling system
5. Consider next development priorities based on project roadmap

The project is now in a stable state with a robust error handling foundation following totality principles and DDD patterns.
