Issue #411 resolved, PR #420 merged successfully. CI passes 100% (290 tests, 5/5 stages). However, multiple critical issues remain open: Issue #418 (domain boundary architecture), #415 (dual error system), #417 (type safety violations), plus PR #419 pending. High-priority bugs affect system reliability and DDD compliance.

Things to be done: Address remaining critical issues starting with #418 domain boundary architecture violation, merge PR #419, resolve type safety issues, improve test coverage from current state, fix template processing bugs.
