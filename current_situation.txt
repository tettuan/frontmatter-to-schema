Current Situation: ✅ CI PASSING - TECHNICAL DEBT RESOLVED! All 307 tests successful, type safety significantly improved. Fixed issue #438 by replacing Record<string, unknown> with proper typed interfaces in registry aggregation logic following DDD and Totality principles. Command data structure now uses flexible typed interface supporting both registry and simple command formats. PR #445 addresses issue #432. Ready to commit technical debt improvements.

Things to be done: URGENT: Commit and push technical debt fixes for issue #438. Create PR for type safety improvements. Review and merge PR #445 for business rule coverage improvements. Continue addressing remaining open issues: #427 (Clean up AI Analysis) and #432 (Test Specification). Secondary: Plan Phase 4 DDD implementation next steps.
