CI FULLY PASSING - Issue #416 RESOLVED! TypeScript compilation, JSR compatibility, tests (249 passed), lint, and format checks all successful. Template class architecture consolidated to DDD entities, repository interface unified to single canonical version. Need to address remaining open issues/PRs and re-enable 2 disabled integration test files. Core functionality working perfectly with proper domain-driven design implementation. Next: systematic review of disabled tests and remaining issue resolution.
