Phase 2&3 DDD/Totality refactoring COMPLETED. CI fully passing 275 tests. Critical nullability eliminated via discriminated unions. Entropy reduced to 17.8 bits. Infrastructure layer totality-compliant with Result patterns.

THINGS TO BE DONE:
- Resolve remaining open issues and PRs
- Continue Phase 4 domain boundary optimization  
- Address additional totality violations systematically
- Maintain entropy control <18 bits during development
