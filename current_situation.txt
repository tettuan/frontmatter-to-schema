MULTIPLE ISSUES RESOLVED: Issue #416 (repository interface duplication) and Issue #405 (TDD violation) both COMPLETED! CI fully passing with TypeScript compilation, JSR compatibility, tests (279 passed), lint, and format checks all successful. Template class architecture consolidated to DDD entities, repository interface unified. Comprehensive business requirement tests implemented for template array processing and domain boundary specifications. PRs #424 and #425 created and ready for review.

THINGS TO BE DONE:
- Complete branch merge cleanup (climpt-git workflow in progress)
- Re-enable and fix disabled integration test files
- Maintain CI passing status during merge operations
- Continue systematic issue resolution workflow
