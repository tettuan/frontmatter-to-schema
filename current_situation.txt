## Current Situation & Things To Be Done

**Status**: Issue #437 created - Registry template mapping fails. The frontmatter-to-schema generates individual results per file instead of single aggregated registry. Root cause: missing aggregation logic for multi-document processing. CI passing (271 tests).

**Priority Actions**: Fix aggregation in process-documents use case to collect unique c1 values for availableConfigs and combine all commands into single array. Must aggregate data before template mapping stage.
