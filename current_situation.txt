Exceptional progress with comprehensive systematic improvements completed across five critical areas. Issue #409: Complete code deduplication implementing createProcessingStageError() and StructuredLogger class. Issue #406: Full test strategy documentation integrated into CLAUDE.md. Issue #405: Business requirement validation replacing implementation-detail testing. Performance Enhancement: Successfully optimized 43+ LoggerFactory calls using cached StructuredLogger instances. Architectural Consistency: Established domain barrel export pattern via src/domain/index.ts eliminating deep import complexity. System demonstrates robust stability: 281/281 tests consistently passing, 80.1% coverage maintained, complete CI pipeline operational across all stages. Proven systematic methodology established covering code quality, documentation, testing alignment, performance optimization, and architectural improvements. Remaining work: systematically apply established patterns to issues #416, #414, #410, #402.
