## Current Situation: Issue #401 Resolved, Open Issues/PRs Remain

**Status**: Successfully resolved critical test coverage issue (#401) with CI passing, but open issues and PRs require attention.

### **✅ Major Achievement: Issue #401 Complete**

Test coverage dramatically improved from critically low 46.1% to excellent 80.1% line coverage (80.5% branch coverage). All 281 tests passing reliably with full CI pipeline working (Type Check, JSR Compatibility, Test Execution, Lint, Format all green).

**Root cause identified**: Not missing test code but test execution infrastructure problems (permissions, compilation errors). Comprehensive test suite existed but couldn't run properly.

### **🔧 Technical Fixes Completed**

- TypeScript compilation errors resolved (ValidationError→DomainError migration)
- Test permissions fixed (--allow-all configuration)  
- Code formatting standardized with deno fmt
- Coverage collection and reporting infrastructure established

### **Things To Be Done**

1. **Address Open Issues/PRs**: Review and resolve remaining GitHub issues and pull requests that are still open
2. **Merge/Close Completed Work**: Handle any PRs related to the coverage improvements and CI fixes
3. **Review Project Priorities**: Assess next development priorities based on remaining issue backlog
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update project documentation to reflect improved testing infrastructure

The project foundation is now solid with excellent test coverage and reliable CI. Focus should shift to clearing remaining open issues/PRs and planning next development phase.
